Problem 3

1) String a = "hello";
This statement declares and initializes a std::string object a with the value "hello"

2) string b(temp);
This initializes the string b using string character array temp

3) string c = a + b;
This concatenates the string of a with the string of c, the + operator overloaded the std::string class

4) if (string("cat") < string("dog"));
this if statement compares the two std::string objects lexicographically. The condition is true since cat comes before dog alphabetically

5) while(getline(ss, token, ' '))
This extracts tokens from the input stream ss into token using a space as a delimiter. getline reads from the input stream until it encounters the delimiter or reaches the end.
